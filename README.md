## 📄 Shadow SVG Generator
A Home Assistant custom component (via HACS) that generates dynamic SVG graphics showing illuminated sides and realistic shadows based on the Sun or Moon position.  
The SVG image illustrates where the Sun is currently positioned and which side of the house is facing the Sun.  
The integration automatically uses data from Home Assistant (`latitude`, `longitude`, `elevation`, `time_zone`).

---
## 🌟 Features
- House shadow representation based on real-time Sun or Moon position.
- Positioning based on user-defined location (town).
- Customizable colors, dimensions, and shapes via `config.py`.
- Easy integration with Home Assistant via HACS or manual installation.
- Configurable update intervals for real-time shadow representation.
- Output SVG file accessible via Home Assistant's web server.
- Lightweight and efficient, suitable for various Home Assistant setups.

## Lovelace Example
You can display the generated SVG in your Lovelace dashboard using the Picture Entity card or Picture card.
```yaml
type: picture-entity
entity: sensor.shadow_elevation
image: /local/shadow.svg
```

## 🚀 Installation
### Add the Shadow integration via HACS: ###
1. In HACS, go to "Integrations".
2. Click on the three dots in the top right corner and select "Custom Repositories".
3. Enter the repository URL: https://github.com/clmun/Shadow
4. Select "Integration" as the category and click "Add".
5. Restart Home Assistant.
### Add the Shadow integration manual: ###
1. Download the component from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/clmun/Shadow
2. Extract the downloaded files.
3. Create a directory named `shadow` in your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder if it doesn't already exist.
4. Copy the extracted files into the `custom_components/shadow` directory.
5. In `configuration.yaml`, add the Shadow sensor configuration as described above.
6. Save the file and restart Home Assistant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. Search for "Shadow" in HACS and install it.
2. In configuration.yaml, add the Shadow sensor configuration as described below.
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: shadow
    name: Shadow Elevation
    town: Sibiu
    output_path: /config/www/shadow.svg
    update_interval: 60
```
3. All settings needed for generating the picture (.svg format) are stored in `config.py` (colors, dimensions, shape coordinates).
Minimal example configuration:
 ```python
WIDTH = 100
HEIGHT = 100
BG_COLOR = "black" # Background color
PRIMARY_COLOR = "green" # Color of the shape
LIGHT_COLOR = "yellow" # Color of the illuminated side
SUN_RADIUS = 4 # Radius of the sun
SUN_COLOR = "orange" # Color of the sun
MOON_RADIUS = 4 # Radius of the moon
MOON_COLOR = "gray" # Color of the moon

SHAPE = [
    {'x': 40, 'y': 40}, # Bottom-left corner
    {'x': 60, 'y': 40}, # Bottom-right corner
    {'x': 60, 'y': 60}, # Top-right corner
    {'x': 40, 'y': 60}  # Top-left corner
]
```
4. After configuring config.py file restart Home Assistant.
5. The SVG file will be generated at the specified output path. /config/www/shadow.svg
6. Access the SVG file via Home Assistant's web server at `http://<your-home-assistant-url>/local/shadow.svg`.
7. You can then use this SVG in your Lovelace dashboard or other places within Home Assistant.
8. Enjoy your dynamic shadow SVG graphics!

## Inspiration
This integration was inspired from OpenHAB community and adapted for Home Assistant.

When I started with home automation, 10 years ago, I've started with OpenHAB and found this script and this idea fascinating.

Later, when I moved to Home Assistant, I kept the script and had the shadow running for all this time, but always waited for somebody more experimented to bring this to Home Assistant.

Well, in the end, with a big help from AI, I did it myself and share it now with the community.

So many thanks to the OpenHAB community for the original idea! And big thanks to AI for helping me with the adaptation to Home Assistant.:) (this line was generated by AI :) )
